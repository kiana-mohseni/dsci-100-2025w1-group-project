    "# **Questions**\n",
    "One main broad question of interest is, which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data? This question contributes to the research by targeting players who contribute most to the recruiting efforts.The question is very broad; therefore, we can narrow it down to a more specific question. This question is: Does the different experience level, subscription status, and gender of the players affect how long they play for?\n",
    "The variables used in the question are divided into two. The response variable is the played_hours. The exploratory variables include experience, subscription, and gender variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This question can be answered by using the players.csv data because the data already includes the variables that we need to reach a conclusion. At the same time, we can see the total hours played clearly instead of reading the date and time between the start time and end time like in sessions.csv data. I will wrangle the players.csv data by selecting the response and exploratory variables. Then, create tables and graphs that show the relationship of each exploratory variable with the response variable's average to see patterns. These patterns will make it easier for researchers to target players who contribute more to the research because when players play for a longer time, this will create more data."

    "# **Methods & Plan**\n",
    "The prediction analysis method that should be used in this case is regression because the response variable, which is played hours, is a numerical value. In order to do modelling, the player data response table will be used. First, the data will be split into training and testing sets. Now that we have a training set, a recipe will be created, and next, we will fit both the KNN and linear regression models. Lastly, predictions for both models can be made on their testing sets, and the RMSPE(Root Mean Squared Prediction Error) of each will be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models will be compared, and the model with the lower RMSPE will be interpreted. We will assume that the linear regression model has a lower RMSPE and that there is a linear relationship between the variables; these assumptions are what leads to the decision to use linear regression instead of KNN regression. There is no need to use cross-validation because we are not trying out many different sets of predictors. In this case, we should use linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some advantages of using linear regression are that you have coefficients that are slopes and intercepts; they show more than KNN does. KNN just predicts based on points nearby. Also, using linear regression is faster than using KNN regression, and it doesn't require a lot of data to find a reasonable fit; it works with far fewer data. However, it cannot capture nonlinear patterns."
